AppCity App
=========

###Description##

This was a project for the class CS317 at the university of Strathclyde. The class focuses on mobile development and the issues it creates in terms of user interaction. It is more about the design rather than development, hence the web app.

We have decided to create an app that encourages users to share events and places in their local community involving them in the community and getting them learning about and exploring there local area. Of course this can also be used when away from the users local area, as a crowd sourced tourist guide. 


###Tools and Frameworks###

CSS written in [sass](http://sass-lang.com/).

[JQuery](http://jquery.com/) heavily used and loved.

DataBase connections handled by [edrackham's](http://edrackham.com/) handy [class](https://github.com/a1phanumeric/PHP-MySQL-Class).

###Set Up###

There are three main folders in this project.

The App folder contains the html5 app, the contents should be placed in the root directory that you wish to serve the app from.

The Backend folder contains the php API that the App requires to run. The contents should be placed in the folder 'api/v1' relative to the root folder the app is deployed in. This folder contains a folder called hidden where you should place the information for connecting the the database into the template.

The last folder SQL, contains the SQL commands required to set up the database.
